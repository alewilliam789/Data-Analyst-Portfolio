# Interactive World Map 
Project Goal: Provide ad-hoc analysis on data from the Top 100 Banks in 2017 in the world in a Juptyer Notebook that uses the psycopg2 database adapter to link personal PostgreSQL database. This notebook allows me to utilize Python to execute my queries and provides visualizations including a pie chart of top 10 countries by total assets managed using a group by statement, a bar graph showing percentage of top assets managed by each country using a sum aggregation with pandas manipulation, and finally an interactive choropleth map using a left outer join query to append the iso codes for each country.
