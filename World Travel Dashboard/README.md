# World Travel Dashboard
Project Goal: Create an app/dashboard that allows a traveller to look at specific regions in the globe and learn various metrics about how well traveled a country is, how much travel has grown in this country, how safe and affordable this country is, and also what the top places to go in this country.

Data Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.ARVL,https://www.travelsafe-abroad.com/countries/, www.planetware.com, www.thecrazytourist.com, https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/hotel_and_restaurant_prices_wb/
